## Metaverse Server

While the [metaverse server](https://github.com/kasenvr/project-apollo) is still in development, much progress has been made since starting. The project has over **150 commits** at the time of publishing these release notes, with over 20 commits in the last two weeks (July 1st - July 14th, 2020). Building upon the foundation that Zontreck had placed, Misterblue has created a working prototype of the metaverse. After adequate testing and completion of the system is complete, we will begin the transition to our very own federated metaverse system!

The [metaverse server interface](https://github.com/kasenvr/project-apollo-dashboard) has also gotten underway this month. It will serve as the UI foundation for admins and users alike to access and administrate their identities on the metaverse. It has had **18 commits** in the last two weeks (July 1st - July 14th, 2020).

## Extra Applications

#### Explore App (Interim Version)

The numbers at the end of each item are the PR numbers in the Decentralized GoTo [repo](https://github.com/kasenvr/Decentralized_GoTo_Experimental).

* Update the Explore app's sorting order to be higher in the menu. (#5)

#### Community Apps

The numbers at the end of each item are the PR numbers in the Community Apps [repo](https://github.com/kasenvr/community-apps).

#### Inventory App

This is a new app that will be introduced to the community apps repo upon merging into the main project-athena codebase (#521). It will serve as the initial implementation of an inventory system into Vircadia, later it will incorporate the functions of the "More" app, that app will be deprecated at such a time.

#### Slider App

This is another new app whose primary functionality is the syncing and displaying of content from control tablets to big screens. A handy feature of it is the one to many functionality where ten tablets can control five screens for example if needed using channels. This is good for presentations and such. This app will be merged into the main project-athena codebase upon further work on its initial version.
