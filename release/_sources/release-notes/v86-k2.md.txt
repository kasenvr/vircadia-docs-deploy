#### General

* The ability for the Metaverse API (Grid Server) URL to be changed by script via settings has been added. No UI toggle has been added yet. (#33)
* Added full desktop chat UI with local, domain, and inter-domain capabilities. Not in a VR usable state yet. (#12, #13, #69, #88, #107, #111, #135, #170)
* Serverless JSON domains can now be loaded over HTTP. This means you can create a domain, export it to JSON, then upload it to a webserver to be visited in the Interface. (#160)

* Relabeled the old "goto" app's icon as "Old Goto". (#240)
* Add a "More" app that lists and installs community-made scripts and apps directly from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kasenvr/community-apps). (#187)
* This takes longer than you might expect: Tons of revisions to brand/debrand, update links, docs, rehost, etc. in the Interface by various contributors. Thank you! (#9, #11, #19, #23, #34, #37, #38, #40, #44, #47, #50, #58, #70, #71, #75, #85, #89, #91, #99, #100, #105, #116, #177, #219)
