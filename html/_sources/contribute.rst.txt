Vircadia is an open-source project, so all of our code and documentation is available for you to look at. You too can contribute to our endeavor for the metaverse! 

Our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena>`_ contains the source to many of the components of our software for creating virtual worlds. The project embraces distributed development. If you find a small bug and have a fix, pull requests are welcome.
