Bring Visitors to Your Domain
#############################

Now that you have a domain up and running, its time to invite people in to your domain and create your community in the virtual world. Here are some ways to bring more visitors in to your domain.

-------------------
Invite Your Friends 
-------------------

Nothing is more inviting than a personal invitation to come check out an exciting, new place in the metaverse! Invite your friends with a personal message to visit your domain. 

Share your domain by giving out its IP address or place name. Anyone with a Vircadia account can enter the IP address or place name directly into the GoTo app to teleport directly to your domain.

.. note:: TIP: You can send other Vircadia users clickable URLs that send them directly to your domain. Simply send them the URL ``https://hifi.place/<domain IP | place name>``. When they click the link, they will be prompted to open Interface.exe and land at the spawn point in your domain.

----------------------------------------------
Add Your Domain to the Explore App
----------------------------------------------

The Explore app is designed to advertise public domains across the metaverse.

In order to be featured on Vircadia's Explore app, you must add a location marker by opening the app and going to the spot in your domain that you want people to spawn at. In your app, scroll to the bottom and click the "Add Location" button, fill it out and you should be set! You may want to open your domain to the public, such as being open to logged in users or everyone. This means that, in your Domain Settings, under 'Standard Permissions', either the 'anonymous' or 'logged-in' group must have the Connect permission.

To restrict access to your domain, you will need to create a blacklist of users without permission to connect to your domain. This can be set up by username, IP address, MAC address or machine fingerprint.

------------------------------------------
Promote Your Community Event with Vircadia
------------------------------------------

To get your event or experience added to the calendar on our website, you can submit it to us by filling out by joining our `Discord<https://discordapp.com/invite/Pvx2vke>` server and reaching out to a Core Team Member.

It will then be:

* Added to Vircadia's `Events Calendar <https://www.vircadia.com/events>`_ 
* Promoted on Vircadia's social channels

--------------------
Blast to Connections
--------------------

If you want to let all of your Vircadia colleagues know about something that’s happening right now, you can blast an announcement to all of your connections. Within about a minute, all of your interested `connections and friends <../explore/socialize.html#make-connections-and-friends>`_ will get notified whenever they come online. 

To send a blast notification: 

1. Take a snapshot of your domain. 

    * In Interface, pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **Snap**.
    * In the Snapshot app, press the large red circle to capture a snapshot.
2. Choose to 'Share: Blast to Connections'.

When a friend or connection clicks on the notification, it will open the GoTo app with your snapshot available. Clicking on the snapshot will take them directly to the place where the picture was taken within the metaverse.  

---------------------------------------------
Post a Snapshot on Social Media
---------------------------------------------

You can also share your domain directly to Twitter or Facebook. To do so:

1. Take a snapshot of your domain. 

    * In Interface, pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **Snap**.
    * In the Snapshot app, press the large red circle to capture a snapshot.
2. Choose to 'Share to Facebook' or 'Share to Twitter'.
3. Log in to your social media account.

When someone clicks the story in their Facebook or Twitter feed, they are taken to a page that gives them more info about the domain. Clicking the picture or “visit” button on that page will bring them to the place where the picture was taken within the metaverse (if they have Interface installed).
